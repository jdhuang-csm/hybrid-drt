## A user's guide to the distribution of relaxation times (DRT): concepts for robust application

Here you can find a webinar on the basics of the DRT, hosted by Gamry Instruments. The tuning approach and software demo discussed in the webinar use the `hybrid-drt` package.

### Abstract:

The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) is a versatile and powerful tool for electrochemical impedance analysis. Unfortunately, many users (or potential users) are frustrated by a lack of understanding of core DRT concepts, the wide array of calculation methods and software, the subjectivity of tuning, and the difficulty of interpreting results. This webinar will seek to empower users by providing a clear understanding of the DRT to enable robust, reproducible, and interpretable analyses.
This webinar will cover:

* The concept of the DRT and how it relates to other modeling approaches 
* Why the DRT calculation is ambiguous and the importance of tuning 
* A conceptual (and lightly mathematical) introduction to DRT calculation methods 
* How to apply the DRT to experimental data, from best practices to potential pitfalls
* Opportunities for more advanced usage of the DRT
 
Experimental examples will be drawn from solid-state devices, but the principles should be applicable to a wide range of fields.
